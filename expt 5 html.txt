<p><h1>A poem dedicated to indian army</h1><p>
</i></b>

<h3>Oh! soliders 
Oh! our brave soldiers,
Thanks you for being our countrys firm shoulders.
tricolour flag waving up in the sky,
keeping in mind you always qaulify.

Oh soliders , because of you we have a peaceful sleep, 
Taking on the bullets your wounds are so deep. 
Army is not just a proffesion,
But it is a love for nation and fearless dedication.

you serve the nation with your blood and sweat,
Making sure that it is never under a threat.
Form north to south east to west,
our country,s solideries are beyond the best
